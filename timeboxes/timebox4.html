        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>For Timebox Four, one of the biggest priorities was refining our current levels and puzzles by adding more UI indicators, particle effects, fixing any bugs, and implementing different cameras. We also wanted to finish up the remaining levels for the Safari, Polar, and Desert exhibits. We also started planning out the animals for the Jungle Exhibit.</p>

        <h2>Concept Ideas and Design</h2>
        <p>Below are some concept ideas from designing the lion/cave level, how to refine the level select area, and the design for the scorpion level.</p>

        <h2>What We Accomplished</h2>
        <h3>Reindeer Level</h3>
        <p>The reindeer level is an open level where you must find all twenty-five puzzle pieces in order to escape. The twenty-five puzzle pieces are scattered around the map, and you're able to use the reindeer's special ability of flying in order to reach high places. Once you find all the pieces, you must solve the jigsaw puzzle.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Scorpion Level</h3>
        <p>The scorpion level is a stealth based level where you try to avoid the spotlights. If you are in the direct beam of a spotlight, then you get reset to the last checkpoint. To avoid spotlights, you can hide under bridges or run away from the moving light. In this level, you can use the scorpion to place a block to help aid jumps.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Wolf Level</h3>
        <p>The wolf level is based around combat as you climb up a mountain and defeat ghosts. You are able to switch to the wolf which has the special ability of summoning a pack of wolves to attack the closest enemy. Once you reach the top of the mountain, you'll be able to escape.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Lion/Cave Level</h3>
        <p>The lion level is also based around combat as you go through three different sections to reach the cave at the end. You must defeat all the enemies in each section before you can move on. In order to lower the gate in each section, you complete the minefield puzzle. Once you are in the cave, you will use all of the safari animals and their special abilities to defeat the evil lion.</p>

        <h3>Jungle Animals</h3>
        <p>We implemented the last three animals for our game which are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gorilla: Grapple hook shot ability</li>
            <li>Viper: Speed boost ability</li>
            <li>Crocodile: Mud shot ability</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Camera Adjustments</h3>
        <p>For each level, we created custom cameras that would change based on the animal you were playing as. We also implemented static cameras for certain puzzles such as the ones in the elephant level. We also worked on camera pans and transitions after a certain event had been triggered.</p>

        <p>The following levels were refined:</p>
        <ul>
