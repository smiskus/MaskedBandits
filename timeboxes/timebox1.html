        <h2>Summary</h2>  
        <p>Timebox One was mostly thinking of ideas on how we wanted to implement a game. We tossed around a few different genres before deciding on a platform/puzzle game. We drew inspiration from games like Super Mario 64, Space Station Silicon Valley, and Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. We met three times a week to discuss our ideas, assign issues, and keep everyone updated on the progress we were making.</p>

        <h2>Concept Designs & Ideas</h2>
        <p>We had a lot of ideas on how we wanted to implement our code and what the levels would look like. Alex drew a diagram that outlined the animal interfaces, and Sara drew a rough idea of what the tutorial level would look like.</p>
