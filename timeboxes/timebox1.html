        <h2>Summary</h2>  
        <p>Timebox One was mostly thinking of ideas on how we wanted to implement a game. We tossed around a few different genres before deciding on a platform/puzzle game. We drew inspiration from games like Super Mario 64, Space Station Silicon Valley, and Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. We met three times a week to discuss our ideas, assign issues, and keep everyone updated on the progress we were making.</p>

        <h2>Concept Designs & Ideas</h2>
        <p>We had a lot of ideas on how we wanted to implement our code and what the levels would look like. Alex drew a diagram that outlined the animal interfaces, and Sara drew a rough idea of what the tutorial level would look like.</p>

        <h2>What We Accomplished</h2>
        <p>For Timebox One, we were able to complete all the requirements listed as well as start on some features for Timebox Two. This included creating a Logo, Main Menu, Level Select, Game Over, and Loading screens which can be seen below. We also implemented player controls, character animations, collisions, and the ability to record or take a screenshot during game play. </p>

        <p>Additionally, we worked on finishing the tutorial level by setting up the tutorial level and developing the first puzzle. The wire puzzle's objective is to connect the wires together in order to lower the draw bridge to the next scene. The wire puzzle will be used in other areas of the game, and increase in complexity by having a larger grid and more components. We also started working on laying out the giraffe enclosure, which we intend to finish for Timebox Two.</p>

        <h2>Team Organization</h2>
        <p>We use Github, Zenhub, and Discord as a team. Below is an example of what our Zenhub board looks like as well as some code metrics:</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, here were our roles this Timebox:</p>
