        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In Timebox Two, we refined our game concept by deciding on the amount of levels, exhibits, and animals we wanted to implement. We cleaned up the tutorial level and worked on two other levels for the Safari Exhibit. We also brainstormed a few other puzzles that could be implemented throughout the game. Additionally, we worked on handling saving and loading games, beginning AI movement, and refactoring code.</p>
        <h2>Concept Ideas and Design</h2>
        <h3>Puzzles</h3>
        <p>We brainstormed potential puzzle ideas that we could implement for future levels. This included: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mastermind: The user has a four color code where they have a certain amount of tries to guess. The only feedback they get is whether they have a correct color and the correct position or if they have a coorect color but not the correct position without knowing which specific color it is referring to.</li>
            <li>Word Riddle: This is a riddle used to open a safe. The riddle can be found in the nearby area, normally in a trashcan.</li>
            <li>Voltorb Flip: This has a similar premise to mindsweeper where you are given the amount of "voltorbs" in the given row/column that you must avoid. You are also given the total sum of the row/column. Your objective is to uncover all the numbers.</li>
            <li>Hippo/Weight Puzzle: This would be like Simon Says where a hippo or another weight centered animal would have to stand on pressure plates in a specific order. To get to these pressure plates, the player would need to switch between the raccoon and the weight centered animal.</li>
        </ul>
