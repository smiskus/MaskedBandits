        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>In Timebox Two, we refined our game concept by deciding on the amount of levels, exhibits, and animals we wanted to implement. We cleaned up the tutorial level and worked on two other levels for the Safari Exhibit. We also brainstormed a few other puzzles that could be implemented throughout the game. Additionally, we worked on handling saving and loading games, beginning AI movement, and refactoring code.</p>

        <h2>Concept Ideas and Design</h2>

        <h3>Game Concept Refinement</h3>
        <p>Our game concept evolved from our first timebox. We decided to have four exhibits--Safari, Desert, Ice/Tundra, and Jungle. Each exhibit would have four levels to it, and four corresponding animals with special abilities. Animals would only be available to link in the level that they are in. So for example, the Safari exhibit would have a Giraffe Level, a Zebra Level, a Hippo Level, and a Lion Level. We also want to develop the game so that the player must complete the Safari exhibit first in order to unlock the rest of the zoo.</p>

        <h3>Puzzles</h3>
        <p>We brainstormed potential puzzle ideas that we could implement for future levels. This included: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mastermind: The user has a four color code where they have a certain amount of tries to guess. The only feedback they get is whether they have a correct color and the correct position or if they have a coorect color but not the correct position without knowing which specific color it is referring to.</li>
            <li>Word Riddle: This is a riddle used to open a safe. The riddle can be found in the nearby area, normally in a trashcan.</li>
            <li>Voltorb Flip: This has a similar premise to mindsweeper where you are given the amount of "voltorbs" in the given row/column that you must avoid. You are also given the total sum of the row/column. Your objective is to uncover all the numbers.</li>
            <li>Hippo/Weight Puzzle: This would be like Simon Says where a hippo or another weight centered animal would have to stand on pressure plates in a specific order. To get to these pressure plates, the player would need to switch between the raccoon and the weight centered animal.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Level Design</h3>
        <p>Below are some sketches for the Level Select Zoo area, the office area in the Giraffe Level, and the Zebra Level:</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What We Accomplished</h2>

        <h3>Animal Abilities</h3>
        <p>We worked on choosing which animals we wanted to have in each exhibit as well as they're abilities. There are four focus areas for animals--rigidbody physics, movement based, unique ability, and attacking.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Safari Exhibit: Hippo (moves objects), Zebra (dash ability), Giraffe (interact with tall objects), Lion (attack)</li>
            <li>Desert Exhibit: Elephant (moves objects), Fire Salamander (spits fire), Scorpion (places a block), Desert Hare(jumps high)</li>
            <li>Polar Exhibit: Polar Bear (moves objects), Reindeer (fly for a short duration), Penguin (throw snowballs), Wolf (attack)</li>
        </ul>

            </video> 
        </div>
        <p>Additionally, we fixed it so that animals can no longer climb up steep terrain slopes and instead slide down them without the ability to jump.</p>

                <source src="../video/sliding.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video> 
        </div>

        <h3>Giraffe Level</h3>
        <p>We broke up the Giraffe Level into five different sections for people to work on. The first section is based around platforming, the second on a platform puzzle to get across the lake, the third a giraffe lever puzzle, the fourth another platform area, and the fifth a puzzle area.</p>
        <div class="panel">
            <img height="300px" src="../img/timebox2/section1_design.PNG">
            <img height="300px" src="../img/timebox2/section2.PNG">
            <img height="300px" src="../img/timebox2/section3.PNG">
        </div>
        <p>Above are the first three sections in order. To get across the lake, the raccoon jumps on lily pads that will trigger more lily pads to rise. There is a specific order in which the raccoon must jump on the lily pads for the correct path to appear. For the third section, the player must use the giraffe in order to interact with the levers. Pulling the levers rises and lowers the platforms to the left at different rates, and the objective is to get them in the correct position so the raccoon can jump on them.</p>
        <div class="panel">
            <img height="300px" src="../img/timebox2/warehouse.png">
            <img height="300px" src="../img/timebox2/office.png">
            <img height="300px" src="../img/timebox2/word_puzzle.png">
        </div>
        <p>Above are the fourth and fifth sections in order. The fourth section is a warehouse platform where you try to get to the door on the other side. The fifth is an office where you are trying to get the key in order to help the giraffe escape. The key is located in the safe, and there is a riddle that can be found in the trashcan that will open the safe. The answer to the riddle is a five letter word.</p>

        <h3>Zebra Level</h3>
        <p>We also implemented the beginning of the Zebra Level, which is primarily a platform area. For each group of platforms, the player needs to complete a puzzle in order to raise them. The platforms will lower after a specified amount of time, which means that the player needs to quickly get across them.</p>
        <div class="panel">

            </video> 
        </div> 

        <h3>Penguin Level</h3>
        <p>Additionally, we implemented the penguin level which is based around the penguin's ability to throw snowballs and affect the course of motion when standing on an iceberg. To complete the level, you must hit all twelve spheres that are scattered throughout the level.</p>
        <div class="panel">

            </video>
        </div>

        <h3>Saving, Loading, and Pausing Games</h3>
        <p>We were able to implement the saving and loading of games using local saved files and creating a GameManager class. Additionally, these tied into the placement of checkpoints throughout the levels which would save the player's position if they were to die. We also added a pause menu that the player will be able to access at any point in the game.</p>

        <h3>AI NPC</h3>
        <p>We started looking into how to implement AI enemies and began with developing the AI for passive animals.</p>

        <h2>Roadblocks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We had some issues with git lfs and had to pay for an upgraded account for more storage. 
            </li>
            <li>
                We also had some general git problems when trying to switch between branches. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Initially we ran into some problems with the animal rigid body.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scaling the camera and player movement to fit the terrain became tricky.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Team Organization</h2>
        <p>We continued using the tools from Timebox One which included Github, Zenhub, and Discord. Our roles this timebox were the following: </p>
