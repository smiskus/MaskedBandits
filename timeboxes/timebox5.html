        <h2>Summary</h2>     
        <p>For Timebox Five, we worked on finishing up all the levels that will be in our game (a total of sixteen) and refining previous levels we had already completed. We also worked on fixing numerous bugs that came up including animals going out of bounds, animal controls, and build issues. In the end, we were able to make a working build that has a semi-complete version of our game.</p>
        
        <h2>Concept Ideas and Design</h2>
        <p>To plan out the last few levels, a few designs were made for the viper and the crocodile level. They can be seen below:</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What We Accomplished</h2>
        <h3>Gorilla Level</h3>
        <p>The gorilla level focuses on the main special ability of the gorilla who is able to grapple onto trees. The player can switch into first person mode in order to aim the grapple and then use left click to grapple. Once the user is in grapple mode, they can hold left click and use WASD to swing around. The gorilla level is based around finding all the puzzle boxes and completing the memory puzzle in order to escape the enclosure.</p>

        <h3>Viper Level</h3>
        <p>The viper level is based on timed challenges where you have to find all the treasure chests in a specific area in order to activate bridges, gates, and platforms. The viper has the special ability to have a quick speed boost which can help complete these timed challenges. Treasure chests are activated by going near them with any animal, and the player also has to look out for explosive barrels which will cause them to respawn.</p>

        <h3>Crocodile Level</h3>
        <p>The crocodile level is focused on combat where the player can use the crocodile's special ability of throwing mud shots in order to defeat the spider enemies.</p>

        <h3>Final Level</h3>
        <p>We split the final level into two parts. The first part has the player using the giraffe, fire salamander, polar bear, and viper to escape from the zoo. There are four different sections to the first part, which include lighting on the lanterns with the giraffe's special, sliding down roofs with the fire salamander, activating pressure plates with the polar bear to move spotlights, and disable all the electric boxes within a certain amount of time with the viper.</p>

        <h3>Level Refinements</h3>
        <p>We refined various levels by checking map boundaries, enhancing the terrain and scenery, adding passive animals, and working on additional cut scenes and camera transitions.</p>
